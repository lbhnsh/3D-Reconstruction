# Week 1
This week is just a basic understanding on what neural networks are.
**Neural Networks**
Neural networks are layers which contains neurons, which are nodes that perform certain tasks such as linear functions or activation functions. There neurons are present in different amounts in different layers and are connected through huge number of interconnections.

These neural networks can take number of inputs regarding various data regarding to our problem and the neural network will itself has parameters and weights which are adjusted in order to get the most accurate result for our problem.

**Supervise Machine learning**
Supervised machine learning is the term used when we use well labelled data in order to train our machine learning models.

There are majorly two types of data Structured Data and Unstructured Data.

Neural Networking is getting a lot of attention as the classical models required Stuctured data to work with and were perforfing underwhelming for unstructured data and large amount of data.

But in this digital age the amount of Data is huge and huge portion of data is unstructured, and thanks to new deep learning models and neural networks, machine learning models are much better capable of understanding unstructured data.
